# Arguments
- `frequencies`: Vector of frequencies (Hz)
- `resistivities`: Vector of resistivities (Ω·m)
- `thicknesses`: Vector of thicknesses (m)
- `dz`: Grid spacing (m)
- `z_max`: Maximum depth (m) 

# Returns
- `ρa`: Apparent resistivity (Ω·m)
- `φ`: Phase (degrees) 

TODO: compute default dz and z_max based on the input resistivities and thicknesses 
TODO: replace solver to LinearSolve.jl for better performance
